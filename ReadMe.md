# Mask2Former with TensorFlow

This project is an implementation of **Mask2Former** using the TensorFlow framework. The goal is to provide a clear explanation of how Mask2Former works and demonstrate how the model can be implemented with TensorFlow.

## About Mask2Former

Mask2Former is a model designed for computer vision tasks, specifically instance segmentation.

To understand instance or panoptic segmentation better, consider the example below, where multiple objects—whether of the same or different classes—are identified as separate instances, each with its own segmentation mask (and the probability of belonging to a certain class):

Current implementation of Mask2Former applies ResNet-50 as a backbone.

## Installation, Dependencies, and Requirements

The project has been tested on <strong>Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS</strong> with <strong>nvcr.io/nvidia/tensorflow:25.02-tf2-py3 container using TensorFlow 2.17.0</strong>. It may work on other operating systems and TensorFlow versions (older than 2.17.0), but we cannot guarantee compatibility.

If you don't use the container, you need to install the following dependencies:

- Python 3.12.3
- All dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.
- Use `setup.sh` to install all dependencies on Linux.

> <strong>Note:</strong> A GPU with CUDA support is highly recommended to speed up training.

## Datasets

The code supports datasets in the COCO format. We recommend creating your own dataset to better understand the full training cycle, including data preparation. [LabelMe](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme) is a good tool for this. You don’t need a large dataset or many classes to begin training and see results. This makes it easier to experiment and learn without requiring powerful hardware.  
Alternatively, you can use the original [COCO dataset](https://cocodataset.org/#home), which contains 80 object categories. You can also train your own large dataset because the model suits well for this task.

For high-performance results we chose TFRecord format for the dataset. TensorFlow is able to use TFRecord format files for parallel reading and is compatible with TensorFlow Graph Mode. To use the dataset, follow these steps:

1) Convert your COCO dataset to TFRecord files:

```bash
python convert_coco_to_tfrecord.py \
  --images_root /path/to/images \
  --annotations /path/to/instances_train.json \
  --output /path/to/out/train.tfrecord \
  --num_shards 4
```

```bash
python convert_coco_to_tfrecord.py \
  --images_root /path/to/images \
  --annotations /path/to/instances_val.json \
  --output /path/to/out/test.tfrecord \
  --num_shards 4
```

For Panoptic Segmentation:

```bash
python convert_coco_to_tfrecord.py \
  --images_root /path/to/images \
  --annotations /path/to/panoptic_train.json \
  --panoptic_masks_root /path/to/panoptic_masks \
  --output /path/to/out/panoptic_train.tfrecord \
  --num_shards 4
```

2) Set corresponding settings in `config.py` file:

```python
self.tfrecord_dataset_directory_path  = 'path/to/tfrecords/train/directory'
self.tfrecord_test_path = 'path/to/tfrecords/test/directory'
```

For Panoptic Segmentation:

```python
self.use_panoptic_dataset = True
self.tfrecord_panoptic_dataset_directory_path = 'path/to/tfrecords/panoptic_train/directory'
self.tfrecord_panoptic_test_path = 'path/to/tfrecords/panoptic_test/directory'
```

## Configuration

All configuration parameters are defined in `config.py` file within the `Mask2FormerConfig` class.

(Optionally) Set the path to your COCO root directory:

```python
self.coco_root_path = '/path/to/your/coco/root/directory'
```

Set the path to your COCO training dataset:

```python
self.tfrecord_dataset_directory_path  = 'path/to/tfrecords/directory'
```

Set the path to the dataset's annotation file:  

```python
self.train_annotation_path = f'{self.coco_root_path}/annotations/instances_train2017.json'
```

For Panoptic Segmentation:

```python
# Panoptic Segmentation
self.use_panoptic_dataset = True
self.panoptic_train_annotation_path = f'{self.coco_root_path}/annotations/panoptic_train2017.json'
self.tfrecord_panoptic_dataset_directory_path = 'path/to/tfrecords/panoptic_train/directory'
self.tfrecord_panoptic_test_path = 'path/to/tfrecords/panoptic_test/directory'
```

And you can find other intuitive parameters:

```python
# Image parameters
self.img_height = 480
self.img_width = 480

# Transformer architecture parameters
self.transformer_input_channels = 256 # Channel dimension for transformer inputs
self.num_decoder_layers = 6           # Number of transformer decoder layers
self.num_heads = 8                    # Number of attention heads
self.dim_feedforward = 1024           # Feed-forward network dimension

# If load_previous_model = True: load the previous model weights.
self.load_previous_model = False
self.lr = 0.0001
self.batch_size = 16
# If load_previous_model = True, the code will look for the latest checkpoint in this directory or use this path if it is a specific checkpoint file.
self.model_path = './checkpoints'  # example for specific checkpoint: self.model_path = './checkpoints/ckpt-5'

# Save the model weights every save_iter epochs:
self.save_iter = 1
self.approx_coco_train_size = 118287
# Number of epochs
self.epochs = 100

# Testing configuration
self.test_model_path = './checkpoints'  # example for specific checkpoint: self.test_model_path = './checkpoints/ckpt-5'
self.score_threshold = 0.5

# Accumulation mode
self.use_gradient_accumulation_steps = False
self.accumulation_steps = 8

# Dataset options
self.tfrecord_test_path = f'{self.coco_root_path}/tfrecords/test'  # Path to TFRecord test dataset directory. Used for mAP calculation.
self.augment = True
self.shuffle_buffer_size = 4096  # TFRecord dataset shuffle buffer size. Set to None to disable shuffling
self.warmup_steps = 10000
```

## Docker file

The docker file is available in the `docker` directory. nvcr.io/nvidia/tensorflow:25.02-tf2-py3 doesn't contain all the required dependencies, so we use the container from the `docker` directory.

## Training

To start training, run:

```bash
python train.py
```

Using the container:

```bash
docker run --rm --ipc host --gpus all -v /path/to/Mask2Former/directory:/opt/project -v /path/to/datasets/Cocodataset2017:/path/to/datasets/Cocodataset2017 -w /opt/project --entrypoint=  my-tf:latest python train.py
```

Model weights are saved in the `checkpoints` directory every `cfg.save_iter` epochs.

To proceed training:

1) Set configuration parameter `load_previous_model` to `True`:

```python
self.load_previous_model = True
```

2) Set the path to the previously saved model. By default, the latest checkpoint will be used:

```python
self.model_path = './checkpoints'  # example for specific checkpoint: self.model_path = './checkpoints/ckpt-5'
```

## Testing

To test the model:

1) Move your test images in the `/images/test` directory.

2) In the config file, set the path to the model weights you want to test. By default, the latest checkpoint will be used:

```python
self.test_model_path = './checkpoints'  # example for specific checkpoint: self.test_model_path = './checkpoints/ckpt-5'
```

3) Run the test script:

```bash
python test.py
```

Using the container:

```bash
docker run --rm --ipc host --gpus all -v /path/to/Mask2Former/directory:/opt/project -v /path/to/datasets/Cocodataset2017:/path/to/datasets/Cocodataset2017 -w /opt/project --entrypoint=  my-tf:latest python test.py
```

Output images with masks and class labels will be saved in the `/images/res` directory.

## Dataset Evaluation

It is possible to evaluate the data fed to the model before training to ensure that the masks, classes, and scales are applied correctly:

This script generates images with instance or panoptic masks and their corresponding category labels. The outputs are saved in `images/dataset_test`.

By default, it processes the first 200 randomly selected images. To change or remove this limit, edit `test_dataset.py`.

## Test mAP

There is possibility to evaluate how accurate the model is.

1) Set the path to the test dataset in config file:

```python
self.tfrecord_test_path = path/to/tfrecords/test/directory'  # Path to TFRecord test dataset directory. Used for mAP calculation.
```

For Panoptic Segmentation:

```python
# Panoptic Segmentation
self.use_panoptic_dataset = True
self.tfrecord_panoptic_test_path = 'path/to/tfrecords/panoptic_test/directory'
```

2) Run the test mAP script:

```bash
python test_map.py
```
